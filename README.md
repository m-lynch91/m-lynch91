I'm currently undergoing a career transition! I was previously employed as a chemical laboratory technologist in the Oil & Gas industry. I had graduated from Fanshawe College with an advanced diploma in Environmental Technology. After over 7 years in the industry, I built up the courage to chase after a dream I've had for my whole adult life... pursuing a career in software development!

Now, I'm a student at Fanshawe College again, enrolled in Computer Programming and Analysis. And I'm loving it. Currently, I'm going into my final semester and I'm excited to continue working remotely with the RCMP!

My personal highlights from school:
1. Building web APIs using C# / .NET and Node.js and pairing them with front-end frameworks (jQuery, Vue.js, React.js)
2. Building out an Enigma machine in Java.
3. Building a Wordle clone using gRPC.
4. Using C++ to implement several data structures and algorithms

What I'm looking forward to in my final semester:
1. Getting hands on with Angular
2. More practice with AWS devops
3. A course in secure computing
