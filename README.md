I'm currently undergoing a career transition! I was previously employed as a chemical laboratory technologist in the Oil & Gas industry. I had graduated from Fanshawe College with an advanced diploma in Environmental Technology. After almost 6 years in the industry, I built up the courage to chase after a dream I've had for my whole adult life... pursuing a career in software development!

Now, I'm a student at Fanshawe College again, enrolled in Computer Programming and Analysis. And I'm loving it. Currently, I'm in my second co-op work term working for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police!

On my own time, I'm excited about learning Python and once I've finished with Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python", I'm eager to try my hand at building a web api with Django or Flask. Still haven't decided which yet.

My personal highlights from school:
1. Building web APIs using C# / ASP.Net Core and pairing them with front-end frameworks (jQuery, Vue.js / Quasar)
2. Building out an Enigma machine in Java.
3. Using C++ to implement several data structures and algorithms

What I'm looking forward to in my upcoming semesters:
1. Getting hands on with ReactJS, GraphQL, MongoDB (Winter 2024)
2. Advanced C# topics (Winter 2024)
3. Getting hands on with Angular (Fall 2024)
4. More practice with Azure / AWS devops
5. More courses in mobile development (Winter / Fall 2024)
